# UPI -> Unified Payments Interface:
- part of green initiative, Aim of reducing use of paper in Domestic Payment System.

## NPCI : National Payments Corporation of India(2009) :> 
- In 2011 as per one report aveage every individual had done **Only 6 Non-cash** transactions.

- Founded in 2016 just few months before demonitization
- UPI supported too much for current government's cashless economy model. 
- But after COVID its use increases exponentialy, like everyone started using it.
- UPI is a kind of SAAS, we can say which current apps added in their application to process the online payment.
- As per one article I read UPI supports around 10,000 transactions per second.
- In Digital payments almost 80% payments are UPI payments, it is because its easyness to use, and its support for various devices, like nowdaya people are doing UPI transactions throught a simple keypad mobile also like JioPhone.

## Challenges with UPI:
### Online Fraud:
- In Online transaction frauds the major contribution is of UPI only, like scammers are calling a user telling you have won the amount in some contest and to withdraw the amount please follow few steps, then he's doing scam like this. If the person is using it since long he's aware about such things but if someone just started using UPI then he might be scammes.

### Dominance:
- As we know if in particular sector only one player is dominating then he might control the charging for the services.
- Like in UPI, PhonePe is a dominating player which is handling around 45-47 % UPI transactions, second is G-pay which is handling around 30% amd third is Paytm which is handling aroung 13% as per one article.
- To reduce the dominance RBI issued one guideline that in this sector no will dominate more than 30%, so that other players also stay and compete, instead of leaving the field.

## Cost required for UPI transaction:
- As we know UPI is a kind of infrastructure, so definitely they also need money to manage the infrastructure.
- As per one report for processing 800Rs it requires 2 Rs to process that transaction.
- So now currently Govt is paying that charges for us, but in future they might not. So we have to prepare fot that also.
