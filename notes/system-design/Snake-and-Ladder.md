## 1. Introduction

The Snake and Ladder game is a popular board game where players aim to reach the last cell of the board (typically 100) by moving forward based on the roll of a dice. Players encounter ladders, which help them advance faster, and snakes, which send them back to earlier positions.

This Java implementation consists of several classes: `Dice`, `Jumper`, `Player`, `Board`, and the main class `PlaySnakeLadder`.

## 2. Class Descriptions

### Dice.java

The `Dice` class simulates the rolling of a dice.

```java
class Dice {
    int numberOfDice;

    public Dice(int noOfDices) {
        this.numberOfDice = noOfDices;
    }

    int rollDice() {
        double random = Math.random();
        return ((int) (random * (6 * numberOfDice - 1 * numberOfDice))) + 1;
    }

    public int getNoOfDice() {
        return numberOfDice;
    }
}
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `numberOfDice`: Number of dice to roll.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `rollDice()`: Returns a random value between 1 and 6 multiplied by the number of dice.
  - `getNoOfDice()`: Returns the number of dice.

### Jumper.java

The `Jumper` class represents snakes and ladders on the board.

```java
public class Jumper {
    private int startLocation;
    private int endLocation;

    public Jumper(int startLocation, int endLocation) {
        this.startLocation = startLocation;
        this.endLocation = endLocation;
    }

    public int getStartLocation() {
        return startLocation;
    }

    public void setStartLocation(int startLocation) {
        this.startLocation = startLocation;
    }

    public int getEndLocation() {
        return endLocation;
    }

    public void setEndLocation(int endLocation) {
        this.endLocation = endLocation;
    }
}
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `startLocation`: Starting position of the snake or ladder.
  - `endLocation`: Ending position of the snake or ladder.
  
- **Methods**:
  - Getters and setters for `startLocation` and `endLocation`.

### Player.java

The `Player` class represents a player in the game.

```java
public class Player {
    int playerId;
    String playerName;

    public Player(int playerId, String playerName){
        this.playerId = playerId;
        this.playerName = playerName;
    }

    public int getPlayerId() {
        return playerId;
    }

    public void setPlayerId(int playerId) {
        this.playerId = playerId;
    }

    public String getPlayerName() {
        return playerName;
    }

    public void setPlayerName(String playerName) {
        this.playerName = playerName;
    }
}
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `playerId`: Unique identifier for the player.
  - `playerName`: Name of the player.
  
- **Methods**:
  - Getters and setters for `playerId` and `playerName`.

### Board.java

The `Board` class manages the game logic and maintains the state of the game.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Board {
    private Dice dice;
    private Queue<Player> players;
    private List<Jumper> ladders;
    private List<Jumper> snakes;
    private Map<String, Integer> playerCurrentPosition;
    private int boardSize;

    public Board(Dice dice, Queue<Player> players, List<Jumper> snakes, List<Jumper> ladder,
            Map<String, Integer> playersCurrentPosition, int boardSize) {
        this.boardSize = boardSize;
        this.playerCurrentPosition = playersCurrentPosition;
        this.players = players;
        this.ladders = ladder;
        this.snakes = snakes;
        this.dice = dice;
    }

    void startGame() {
        if (players.size() > 1) { // when size is one means only one player is left
            Player player = players.poll(); // gets the first player
            int currentPosition = playerCurrentPosition.get(player.getPlayerName());

            int diceValue = dice.rollDice(); // gets random value between 1-6
            int nextCell = currentPosition + diceValue;

            // if player needs less count but dice gave more
            if (nextCell > boardSize) {
                players.offer(player); // add the player in the queue for next turn
            } else if (nextCell == boardSize) {
                System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " has won the game");
            } else {
                int[] nextPosition = new int[1]; // initialize an array of size 1

                nextPosition[0] = nextCell;
                boolean[] b = new boolean[1]; // to check if the ladder is present

                snakes.forEach(s -> {
                    if (s.getStartLocation() == nextCell) {
                        nextPosition[0] = s.getEndLocation(); // if snake found change the position
                    }
                });

                if (nextPosition[0] != nextCell) {
                    System.out.println("Snake bitten to " + player.getPlayerName());
                }

                ladders.forEach(ld -> {
                    if (ld.getStartLocation() == nextCell) { // ladder found
                        nextPosition[0] = ld.getEndLocation();
                        b[0] = true;
                    }
                });

                if (nextPosition[0] != nextCell && b[0]) {
                    System.out.println(
                            player.getPlayerName() + " has got the ladder and now present at " + playerCurrentPosition.get(player.getPlayerName()));
                }

                if (nextPosition[0] == nextCell) {
                    System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " has won the game");
                } else {
                    playerCurrentPosition.put(player.getPlayerName(), nextPosition[0]);
                    System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " present at " + nextPosition[0]);
                    players.offer(player);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `dice`: Dice object to simulate dice rolls.
  - `players`: Queue of players taking turns.
  - `ladders`: List of ladders on the board.
  - `snakes`: List of snakes on the board.
  - `playerCurrentPosition`: Map of player names to their current positions on the board.
  - `boardSize`: Size of the board (number of cells).

- **Methods**:
  - `startGame()`: Controls the game flow, handling dice rolls, player movements, and encounters with snakes and ladders.

Let's break down the `Board` class implementation and its `startGame` method in more detail.

### Attributes

- **`dice`**: An instance of the `Dice` class to simulate dice rolls.
- **`players`**: A queue of `Player` objects, representing the players taking turns in the game.
- **`ladders`**: A list of `Jumper` objects representing ladders on the board.
- **`snakes`**: A list of `Jumper` objects representing snakes on the board.
- **`playerCurrentPosition`**: A map that tracks the current position of each player. The key is the player's name, and the value is their current position on the board.
- **`boardSize`**: An integer representing the size of the board (number of cells).

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the board with the given dice, players, snakes, ladders, player positions, and board size.

```java
public Board(Dice dice, Queue<Player> players, List<Jumper> snakes, List<Jumper> ladders,
             Map<String, Integer> playerCurrentPosition, int boardSize) {
    this.boardSize = boardSize;
    this.playerCurrentPosition = playerCurrentPosition;
    this.players = players;
    this.ladders = ladders;
    this.snakes = snakes;
    this.dice = dice;
}
```

### Method: `startGame`

The `startGame` method is the main game loop that controls the flow of the game. It processes each player's turn, simulates dice rolls, and handles the interactions with snakes and ladders.

```java
void startGame() {
    if (players.size() > 1) { // Check if more than one player is left
        Player player = players.poll(); // Get the first player from the queue
        int currentPosition = playerCurrentPosition.get(player.getPlayerName()); // Get current position of the player

        int diceValue = dice.rollDice(); // Roll the dice
        int nextCell = currentPosition + diceValue; // Calculate the next cell position

        // If the player moves beyond the board size, re-add them to the queue for the next turn
        if (nextCell > boardSize) {
            players.offer(player);
        } else if (nextCell == boardSize) { // If the player lands exactly on the last cell, they win
            System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " has won the game");
        } else {
            int[] nextPosition = new int[1]; // Initialize an array to store the next position
            nextPosition[0] = nextCell; // Set the next position to the calculated next cell
            boolean[] foundLadder = new boolean[1]; // Boolean flag to check if a ladder is present

            // Check for snakes
            snakes.forEach(snake -> {
                if (snake.getStartLocation() == nextCell) {
                    nextPosition[0] = snake.getEndLocation(); // Update position if a snake is found
                }
            });

            if (nextPosition[0] != nextCell) { // If the position has changed, it means the player encountered a snake
                System.out.println("Snake bitten " + player.getPlayerName());
            }

            // Check for ladders
            ladders.forEach(ladder -> {
                if (ladder.getStartLocation() == nextCell) {
                    nextPosition[0] = ladder.getEndLocation(); // Update position if a ladder is found
                    foundLadder[0] = true; // Set the ladder flag to true
                }
            });

            if (nextPosition[0] != nextCell && foundLadder[0]) { // If the position has changed and a ladder is found
                System.out.println(
                    player.getPlayerName() + " has got the ladder and now present at " + playerCurrentPosition.get(player.getPlayerName()));
            }

            if (nextPosition[0] == nextCell) { // If the position hasn't changed, it means the player won
                System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " has won the game");
            } else { // Update the player's position and add them back to the queue for the next turn
                playerCurrentPosition.put(player.getPlayerName(), nextPosition[0]);
                System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " present at " + nextPosition[0]);
                players.offer(player);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Check Players Count**: The game continues as long as there is more than one player left.
   ```java
   if (players.size() > 1) {
   ```

2. **Retrieve Player**: Get the next player from the queue.
   ```java
   Player player = players.poll();
   ```

3. **Get Current Position**: Fetch the current position of the player from the `playerCurrentPosition` map.
   ```java
   int currentPosition = playerCurrentPosition.get(player.getPlayerName());
   ```

4. **Roll Dice**: Simulate a dice roll.
   ```java
   int diceValue = dice.rollDice();
   ```

5. **Calculate Next Cell**: Determine the next cell based on the current position and dice value.
   ```java
   int nextCell = currentPosition + diceValue;
   ```

6. **Check if Move is Valid**: Ensure the next cell is within the board's bounds.
   ```java
   if (nextCell > boardSize) {
       players.offer(player);
   } else if (nextCell == boardSize) {
       System.out.println(player.getPlayerName() + " has won the game");
   }
   ```

7. **Check for Snakes**: Iterate through the list of snakes to check if the player landed on a snake's start location.
   ```java
   snakes.forEach(snake -> {
       if (snake.getStartLocation() == nextCell) {
           nextPosition[0] = snake.getEndLocation();
       }
   });
   ```

8. **Check for Ladders**: Iterate through the list of ladders to check if the player landed on a ladder's start location.
   ```java
   ladders.forEach(ladder -> {
       if (ladder.getStartLocation() == nextCell) {
           nextPosition[0] = ladder.getEndLocation();
           foundLadder[0] = true;
       }
   });
   ```

9. **Update Position and Queue**: Update the player's position and add them back to the queue for the next turn.
   ```java
   playerCurrentPosition.put(player.getPlayerName(), nextPosition[0]);
   players.offer(player);
   ```


## 3. Main Class (PlaySnakeLadder)

The `PlaySnakeLadder` class contains the main method to initialize and start the game.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Queue;

public class PlaySnakeLadder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dice dice = new Dice(1);

        List<Jumper> snakes = new ArrayList<>();
        snakes.add(new Jumper(99, 3));
        snakes.add(new Jumper(54, 8));
        snakes.add(new Jumper(67, 34));
        snakes.add(new Jumper(44, 18));

        List<Jumper> ladder = new ArrayList<>();
        ladder.add(new Jumper(9, 35));
        ladder.add(new Jumper(4, 88));
        ladder.add(new Jumper(19, 76));
        ladder.add(new Jumper(58, 96));

        Queue<Player> players = new LinkedList<>();
        players.add(new Player(1, "Satish"));
        players.add(new Player(2, "Piyush"));

        int boardSize = 100;
        Map<String, Integer> playersCurrentPosition = new HashMap<>();
        playersCurrentPosition.put("Satish", 0);
        playersCurrentPosition.put("Piyush", 0);

        Board board = new Board(dice, players, snakes, ladder, playersCurrentPosition, boardSize);
        board.startGame();
    }
}
```

### Relationships

- **Board** `has a` **Dice**.
- **Board** `has a` `Queue` of **Player**.
- **Board** `has a` `List` of **Jumper** (snakes).
- **Board** `has a` `List` of **Jumper** (ladders).
- **Board** `has a` `Map<String, Integer>` representing player positions.

### UML Diagram Creation Steps

1. **Create Boxes for Each Class**:
   - Each class should be represented as a box with three sections: the top for the class name, the middle for attributes, and the bottom for methods.

2. **Draw Relationships**:
   - Use arrows to depict relationships between classes:
     - Solid line with a diamond to show aggregation/composition (e.g., `Board` has `Dice`, `Player`, and `Jumper`).

3. **Use Proper Notations**:
   - Public attributes and methods with a `+` sign.
   - Private attributes and methods with a `-` sign.

You can use tools like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, Draw.io, or any other UML diagram software to create the visual representation. Here is a simple textual sketch that you can follow to create the visual UML diagram using these tools.

### Example Visual Diagram in Lucidchart or Draw.io

![UML Diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/templates/uml-diagram-templates)

When creating the UML diagram, make sure you add associations, multiplicities (like 1..* for multiple players), and any other relevant details to accurately depict the structure and relationships within your Snake and Ladder game system.
