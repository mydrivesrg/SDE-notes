# React Redux


## Step 1: Install Redux
- First, you need to install the Redux library and its companion library for React (if you're using React). Open your terminal and run:
```
npm install redux react-redux
```

## Step 2: Create Action Types
```
actionTypes.js

export const LOGIN_SUCCESS = 'LOGIN_SUCCESS';
export const LOGIN_FAILURE = 'LOGIN_FAILURE';
```
## Step #: Create Actions

```
userActions.js

import { LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGIN_FAILURE } from './actionTypes';

export const loginSuccess = (userData) => ({
  type: LOGIN_SUCCESS,
  payload: userData,
});

export const loginFailure = (error) => ({
  type: LOGIN_FAILURE,
  payload: error,
});

```

## Step 3: Create Reducer
- Reducers are functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.

```
authReducer.js
 import { LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGIN_FAILURE } from '../actions/actionTypes';
 const initialState = {
   userData: null,
   error: null,
 };

  const authReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case LOGIN_SUCCESS:
        return {
        ...state,
        userData: action.payload,
        error: null,
      };
    case LOGIN_FAILURE:
      return {
        ...state,
        userData: null,
        error: action.payload,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default authReducer;
```
Step 4: Combine the reducer using combineReducer

```
index.js

import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import authReducer from "./userReducer";

const rootReducer=combineReducers({
     auth:authReducer
})

export default rootReducer;
```

## Step 5: Set Up the Store
- Create a Redux store by defining your state and reducers. The store is the central hub that holds the entire state of your application.

```
store.js

import { createStore } from 'redux';

import rootReducer from '../redux/reducers/index';
const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```
### Now Lets see how to configure it for storing and getting data

## Storing Data in Store
- we can store data in store using mapDispatchToProps method
- For this we need connect and dispatch functions.
### In Redux, dispatch is a function provided by the Redux store. It is used to dispatch actions, which are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the application's state. When you dispatch an action, the Redux store runs its reducer function, which specifies how the state should be updated based on the given action.

### In React-Redux, the connect function is used to connect a React component to the Redux store. It allows the component to subscribe to the Redux store and access the state and actions it needs. The connect function is part of the react-redux library.

```
import axios from "axios";
import { loginFailure, loginSuccess } from "../../redux/actions/userActions";
import { connect } from "react-redux";

const Login = ({ dispatchLoginSuccess, dispatchLoginFailure, data, error }) => {

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:8080/user/login",formData);
      dispatchLoginSuccess(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      dispatchLoginFailure(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="login">
      # Login Code to get Data
    </div>
  );
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  dispatchLoginSuccess: (userData) => dispatch(loginSuccess(userData)),
  dispatchLoginFailure: (error) => dispatch(loginFailure(error)),
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Login);
```
