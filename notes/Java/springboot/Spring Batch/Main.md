### What is Batch Processing?

Batch processing is a technique of processing large volumes of data in a batch or group, typically without manual intervention. The main characteristics include:

- **Scheduled Execution:** Jobs are executed at scheduled times or intervals.
- **Data Processing:** Large data sets are processed in bulk, often involving complex data transformations.
- **Resource Management:** Efficient use of system resources, as jobs are usually designed to handle large volumes of data in an optimized manner.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ability to recover from failures and continue processing from the point of failure.

### What is Spring Batch?

Spring Batch is a framework for batch processing in Java applications. It provides:

- **Easy-to-use APIs** for configuring and executing batch jobs.
- **Built-in features** like job monitoring, transaction management, and restart capabilities.
- **Support for various data sources**, including databases, files, and messaging systems.

Spring Batch helps in building scalable, robust batch processing systems by providing a set of abstractions and utilities.

### Step:

A **step** is a fundamental component of a Spring Batch job. It represents an independent phase of work and is used to define a specific piece of processing logic within a job.

- **Characteristics:**
  - A step can be a task or a chunk of work.
  - Steps can be logically related, forming a sequence of processing stages.
  - Each step can be configured to handle different processing requirements.

- **Example:**
  Suppose you have a job to process customer orders. The job might include steps like:
  1. **Read Orders**: Read orders from a file.
  2. **Process Orders**: Validate and process each order.
  3. **Write Results**: Write the processed results to a database.

### Types of Step:

#### 1. Tasklet Step:

- **Definition:** A Tasklet step performs a single, specific task. It is ideal for simple, one-off tasks.
- **Implementation:** You need to provide an implementation of the `Tasklet` interface and its `execute()` method.
- **When to Use:** 
  - Simple Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
  - Sending notifications or emails.
  - Setting up resources or cleaning up after a job.

#### 2. Chunk-Based Step:

- **Definition:** A Chunk-Based step processes data in chunks, allowing for handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Components:**
  - **`ItemReader`:** Reads items (records) from a data source.
  - **`ItemProcessor`:** Processes each item (e.g., transformation or validation).
  - **`ItemWriter`:** Writes processed items to a data source.
- **When to Use:** 
  - Processing large files or datasets.
  - Scenarios where you need to handle large volumes of data in manageable chunks.

- **Example in Project:**
  If you are processing a large CSV file with customer data, you might use a chunk-based step to read records in chunks of 100, process them, and then write them to a database.

### JobLauncher:

- **Definition:** The `JobLauncher` is responsible for starting the execution of a job.
- **Usage:**
  - Can be invoked programmatically or via schedulers and REST APIs.
  - Allows for parameterized execution of jobs.

### JobRepository:

- **Definition:** The `JobRepository` is used to store metadata about job executions, such as job status and execution history.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Storing information about job instances, executions, and step executions.
  - Facilitates job restarts and recovery by maintaining metadata about previous runs.

### JobInstance:

- **Definition:** Represents a logical run of a job. Each instance is associated with a unique set of job parameters.

### JobExecution:

- **Definition:** Represents the physical execution of a job instance. It contains details about the execution status and context.

### StepExecution:

- **Definition:** Represents the physical execution of a step within a job. It includes details such as the status, read and write counts, and any exceptions encountered.

### Job Parameters:

- **Definition:** Parameters that are passed to a job when it is launched. They can be used to control the job's behavior and execution. Examples include file paths, dates, or other configuration values.

### Architecture of Spring Batch:

- **Components:**
  - **Job:** Defines a batch process and consists of one or more steps.
  - **Step:** Individual phases of processing.
  - **ItemReader, ItemProcessor, ItemWriter:** Components for reading, processing, and writing data.
  - **JobLauncher:** Starts job execution.
  - **JobRepository:** Stores job metadata.

- **Example with Scheduler (IBM Tivoli):**
  1. **Scheduler Trigger:** IBM Tivoli Scheduler triggers the execution of a Spring Batch job at a specified time.
  2. **JobLauncher Invocation:** The Scheduler calls the `JobLauncher` to start the job.
  3. **Job Execution:** Spring Batch processes the job as per the defined steps and components.
  4. **Metadata Storage:** Execution details are stored in the `JobRepository`.
