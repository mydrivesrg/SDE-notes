# Collection Framework:


## 1. Difference between Collection and Collections:
Certainly! Here's a list of interfaces and classes related to collections in Java, along with their packages:

### Interfaces:

1. **Collection (java.util)**:
   - Represents a group of objects known as its elements. It's the root interface in the Java Collections Framework.

2. **List (java.util)**:
   - An ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence). It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order.

3. **Set (java.util)**:
   - A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction.

4. **Queue (java.util)**:
   - A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. It supports FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order for its elements.

5. **Deque (java.util)**:
   - A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. Deque is short for "double-ended queue."

6. **Map (java.util)**:
   - An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys, and each key can map to at most one value.

7. **SortedSet (java.util)**:
   - A set that maintains its elements in ascending order. Elements are sorted according to the natural ordering of the elements or by a comparator provided at set creation time.

8. **SortedMap (java.util)**:
   - A map that maintains its mappings in ascending order based on the keys' natural ordering or a custom comparator.

### Utility Classes:

1. **Collections (java.util)**:
   - A class providing static methods for operating on collections, such as sorting, searching, shuffling, etc.


These are some of the most commonly used collection classes in Java, but there are others as well, each with its own specific characteristics and use cases.

| Aspect             | `Collection`                                     | `Collections`                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Type               | Interface                                        | Utility class                                     |
| Purpose            | Represents a single collection of objects        | Provides utility methods for collections          |
| Usage              | Define behavior and operations for a collection | Manipulate or operate on collections              |
| Examples           | `List`, `Set`, `Queue`                           | `sort`, `binarySearch`, `synchronizedCollection` |
| Relationship       | Root interface in the Collections Framework      | Utility class in the Collections Framework       |
| Package            | `java.util`                                      | `java.util`                                       |
| Mutable/Immutable  | Mutable                                          | N/A (not applicable, as it's a class, not an interface) |

This table provides a quick comparison between `Collection` and `Collections`, outlining their key differences in terms of type, purpose, usage, examples, relationship, package, and mutability.

Certainly! Let's explore some advanced use cases for each of these data structures:

### ArrayList:
1. **Dynamic Resizing:** ArrayList is great for scenarios where you need a resizable array. It dynamically grows as elements are added, which is useful when the number of elements is not known in advance or can change over time.
2. **Efficient Random Access:** ArrayList provides constant-time access to elements by index. This makes it suitable for scenarios where you frequently access elements by their position in the list.
3. **Array-backed Operations:** If you need to perform operations such as sorting, searching, or manipulating elements using array-based algorithms, ArrayList provides a convenient interface for such tasks.

### LinkedList:
1. **Efficient Insertions and Deletions:** LinkedList excels at insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions in the list. If you frequently need to add or remove elements in the middle of a list, LinkedList can be more efficient than ArrayList.
2. **Iterating Operations:** LinkedList supports efficient iteration over its elements using iterators. This makes it suitable for scenarios where you need to traverse the list sequentially, especially if you need to modify the list while iterating.
3. **Implementation of Other Data Structures:** LinkedList can be used as a basis for implementing other data structures such as queues, stacks, or even certain types of trees. Its node-based structure lends itself well to such implementations.

### Stack:
1. **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are commonly used in algorithms for expression evaluation, such as infix to postfix conversion, postfix evaluation, and parentheses matching.
2. **Backtracking Algorithms:** Stack-based backtracking algorithms, like depth-first search (DFS), can be used to solve various problems such as maze-solving, graph traversal, and finding paths in a tree.
3. **Undo Operations:** Stacks are often used to implement undo functionality in applications where users can revert their actions step by step.

### Queue:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Queues are essential for BFS algorithms, which are used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures level by level.
2. **Task Scheduling:** Queues can be used in task scheduling systems where tasks are executed based on their priority or arrival time.
3. **Message Queues:** In distributed systems, queues are often used as message queues to facilitate communication between different components or services.

### HashMap:
1. **Fast Lookup:** HashMap provides constant-time performance for basic operations like put and get. It's ideal for scenarios where you need fast lookups based on keys.
2. **Caching:** HashMaps are commonly used in caching mechanisms to store key-value pairs where the value is expensive to compute or retrieve. This helps in improving the performance of applications by avoiding redundant computations.
3. **Data Aggregation:** HashMaps can be used for data aggregation tasks, where data is grouped based on certain criteria and stored in key-value pairs for efficient retrieval and analysis.

These are just a few examples of how these data structures can be applied in various scenarios. Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, so choosing the right one depends on the specific requirements of your application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Arraylist:
In Java, `ArrayList` is a part of the `java.util` package and is a dynamic array implementation. It provides a resizable array, which can grow or shrink as needed. Here's a brief explanation of `ArrayList`:

1. **Dynamic Sizing**: Unlike arrays, `ArrayList` can dynamically resize itself as elements are added or removed. This makes it convenient for situations where the number of elements is not known in advance.

2. **Indexed Access**: Similar to arrays, elements in an `ArrayList` can be accessed using an index. Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for fast random access.

3. **Generic**: `ArrayList` is generic, meaning it can hold any type of object. However, it's recommended to specify the type of objects it will hold to ensure type safety.

4. **Add and Remove Operations**: `ArrayList` provides methods to add, remove, and modify elements. Adding an element at the end of the list is efficient, but inserting or removing elements in the middle of the list can be relatively slower as it may require shifting subsequent elements.

5. **Iterating Through Elements**: You can iterate through the elements of an `ArrayList` using loops or enhanced for loops. It also provides methods like `forEach` and iterators for traversal.

6. **Automatic Boxing and Unboxing**: `ArrayList` can hold primitive data types through autoboxing and unboxing. For example, you can add `int` values directly to an `ArrayList<Integer>` without explicitly converting them to `Integer` objects.

Here's a simple example of using `ArrayList`:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an ArrayList
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

        // Adding elements
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.add("Orange");

        // Accessing elements
        System.out.println("First element: " + list.get(0));

        // Iterating through elements
        for (String fruit : list) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }

        // Removing an element
        list.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing Banana: " + list);
    }
}
```

## 1. How to convert arraylist to array using collections?

You can convert an ArrayList to an array using the `toArray()` method provided by the `java.util.ArrayList` class. Here's an example demonstrating how to do this:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArrayListToArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ArrayList of strings
        ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        arrayList.add("Apple");
        arrayList.add("Banana");
        arrayList.add("Cherry");

        // Convert ArrayList to an array of strings
        String[] array = arrayList.toArray(new String[0]); // Passing a new array of the desired type

        // Print the elements of the array
        System.out.println("Array elements:");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array)); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Cherry]
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We create an `ArrayList` called `arrayList` and add some strings to it.
- To convert the `ArrayList` to an array, we use the `toArray()` method, passing a new array of the desired type (`String[]` in this case) as an argument.
- The `toArray()` method returns an array containing all elements from the `ArrayList`.
- We then print the elements of the array using `Arrays.toString(array)`.

Note: When calling `toArray(new T[0])`, where `T` is the type of elements in the ArrayList, a new array of the same type is created and returned. If you pass an array of the correct type and size as an argument to `toArray()`, the elements of the ArrayList will be copied into that array.

## Places where array is better than arraylist?
In Java, arrays and collections (like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.) serve different purposes and have their own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some scenarios where arrays might be better suited than collections:

1. **Fixed Size**: If you know the size of the data structure won't change, arrays are more memory efficient and have a fixed size, which means they don't incur the overhead of dynamic resizing like ArrayList or LinkedList.

2. **Performance**: In terms of performance, arrays can be faster than collections because they offer direct access to elements by index without the need for traversal. This is especially true for primitive data types as arrays can store primitives directly, while collections store objects which require boxing/unboxing.

3. **Simple Data Structures**: For simple data storage needs, where you don't require advanced features like automatic resizing or sorting, arrays can be simpler and more straightforward to use.

4. **Multidimensional Data**: Arrays offer built-in support for multidimensional data structures (e.g., arrays of arrays), making them more convenient for representing matrices, tables, or other structured data.

5. **Native Support**: Arrays are a fundamental part of the Java language, and they are directly supported by the JVM. This can make them more efficient in certain cases compared to collections, which are implemented using arrays or other data structures.

6. **Performance Tuning**: In performance-critical applications, where every CPU cycle matters, using arrays with manual memory management and data layout optimizations can sometimes provide better performance compared to collections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. **LinkedList**:

In Java, a LinkedList is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements where each element is a separate object, and each element (a node) is linked to its successor (and sometimes to its predecessor) in the list. 

Here's a brief overview of LinkedList in Java:

1. **Node**: The basic building block of a LinkedList is the Node. Each Node contains an element and a reference to the next Node in the sequence.

2. **Head**: The first element of the list is called the head. It's the entry point for accessing elements in the list.

3. **Tail**: The last element of the list is called the tail. It's the endpoint for accessing elements in the list. In a singly LinkedList, the tail's reference is typically null.

4. **Singly vs. Doubly LinkedList**:
   - **Singly LinkedList**: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Doubly LinkedList**: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence.

5. **Operations**:
   - **Add**: Elements can be added to the beginning, end, or at any specific position in the list.
   - **Remove**: Elements can be removed from the beginning, end, or at any specific position in the list.
   - **Search**: Elements can be searched for by traversing the list sequentially.
   - **Traversal**: Elements can be accessed sequentially by traversing the list.

6. **Performance**:
   - **Insertions and deletions**: LinkedList provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for adding or removing elements at the beginning or end of the list. However, accessing elements at arbitrary positions requires traversing the list, which can take linear time (O(n)).
   - **Space**: LinkedList typically consumes more memory than arrays because of the additional memory required for storing references to the next (and sometimes previous) nodes.

7. **Java Implementation**:
   - In Java, LinkedList is provided as part of the Java Collections Framework under the `java.util` package.
   - It implements the `List` interface and provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
   - Java's LinkedList class provides both singly and doubly LinkedList implementations.

LinkedList is useful when frequent insertions and deletions are required, especially at the beginning or end of the list. However, it may not be as efficient for random access as ArrayList, which provides constant-time access to elements by index.
- Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.LinkedList;

     public class LinkedListExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating a LinkedList of Integers
             LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

             // Adding elements to the LinkedList
             list.add(10);
             list.add(20);
             list.add(30);

             // Accessing elements by index
             System.out.println("First element: " + list.getFirst()); // Output: 10

             // Iterating through the LinkedList
             for (int num : list) {
                 System.out.println(num);
             }
         }
     }
     ```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. **HashSet**:
   - A `HashSet` is an unordered collection of unique elements implemented using a hash table.
   - It does not allow duplicate elements and provides constant-time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.
Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the HashSet in Java.

### Internal Mechanism:
HashSet is internally backed by a HashMap instance. Each element you add to a HashSet is actually stored as a key in the underlying HashMap, with the value being a constant dummy value (`PRESENT`). Since a HashMap does not allow duplicate keys, this effectively ensures uniqueness in HashSet elements.

### Performance:
HashSet provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as add, remove, contains, and size. This is because these operations rely on the hashing mechanism. Hashing allows direct access to elements based on their hash codes, which leads to efficient lookup and insertion.

### Unordered Collection:
HashSet does not maintain the order of elements. When you iterate over a HashSet using an iterator, the order in which elements are returned is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were inserted.

### Unique Elements:
HashSet ensures that it does not contain duplicate elements. When you try to add an element that is already present in the set, the add operation returns false, indicating that the element was not added. This uniqueness property is crucial in scenarios where you need to maintain a collection of distinct elements.

### Null Elements:
HashSet permits the insertion of null elements. You can add null to a HashSet and it will be stored as a single element. However, there can be only one null element in a HashSet because it does not allow duplicates.

### Use Cases:
HashSet is commonly used in scenarios where you need to maintain a collection of unique elements and the order of elements is not important. Some common use cases include:

- Removing duplicates from a collection.
- Checking membership efficiently.
- Implementing algorithms that require sets with constant-time operations.

### Considerations:
- Since HashSet relies on hash codes for efficiency, the performance of HashSet operations can degrade if the hashCode() method of the objects stored in the set does not distribute hash codes evenly.
- The initial capacity and load factor of a HashSet can be adjusted to balance between space and time efficiency based on the expected number of elements and the rate of insertion/deletion operations.

Understanding these internal mechanisms and characteristics can help you utilize HashSet effectively in your Java programs.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.HashSet;

     public class HashSetExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating a HashSet of Strings
             HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();

             // Adding elements to the HashSet
             set.add("Apple");
             set.add("Banana");
             set.add("Orange");
             set.add("Apple"); // Duplicate element, not added

             // Iterating through the HashSet
             for (String fruit : set) {
                 System.out.println(fruit);
             }
         }
     }
     ```
## 25. If i want hashset() but my order should be maintained which collection should i use?

If you want to maintain the order of elements while also ensuring uniqueness (no duplicates) and efficient lookup operations like `set()`, you can use a `LinkedHashSet` in Java. 

A `LinkedHashSet` maintains the insertion order of elements, meaning that when you iterate over the set, the elements are returned in the order in which they were inserted. Additionally, it provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, and `size()`.

Here's an example of using a `LinkedHashSet` to maintain the order of elements:

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;

public class OrderedSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a LinkedHashSet to maintain insertion order
        LinkedHashSet<String> orderedSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();

        // Add elements to the set
        orderedSet.add("Apple");
        orderedSet.add("Banana");
        orderedSet.add("Orange");
        orderedSet.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, will be ignored

        // Print the ordered set (maintains insertion order)
        System.out.println("Ordered Set: " + orderedSet); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
    }
}
```

In this example, the `LinkedHashSet` `orderedSet` maintains the order in which elements are added, ignoring duplicate elements. When you iterate over or print the set, the elements are returned in the same order they were inserted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. **TreeMap**:
   - A `TreeMap` is a sorted map implementation based on a red-black tree.
   - It maintains elements in sorted order based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.TreeMap;

     public class TreeMapExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating a TreeMap of Integer keys and String values
             TreeMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();

             // Adding key-value pairs to the TreeMap
             map.put(3, "Three");
             map.put(1, "One");
             map.put(2, "Two");

             // Accessing values by key (sorted order)
             for (int key : map.keySet()) {
                 System.out.println(key + ": " + map.get(key));
             }
         }
     }
     ```




7. **TreeSet**:
   - A `TreeSet` is a sorted set implementation based on a red-black tree.
   - It maintains elements in sorted order and does not allow duplicate elements.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.TreeSet;

     public class TreeSetExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating a TreeSet of Integers
             TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();

             // Adding elements to the TreeSet
             set.add(10);
             set.add(30);
             set.add(20);
             set.add(10); // Duplicate element, not added

             // Iterating through the TreeSet (sorted order)
             for (int num : set) {
                 System.out.println(num);
             }
         }
     }
     ```

8. **ArrayDeque**:
   - An `ArrayDeque` is a resizable double-ended queue implementation.
   - It allows efficient insertion and removal operations at both ends of the deque.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.ArrayDeque;

     public class ArrayDequeExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating an ArrayDeque of Strings
             ArrayDeque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

             // Adding elements to the front and back of the deque
             deque.addFirst("First");
             deque.addLast("Last");

             // Accessing elements at the front and back of the deque
             System.out.println("First element: " + deque.getFirst());
             System.out.println("Last element: " + deque.getLast());
         }
     }
     ```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 26. Queue Data Structure:

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the end (rear) and removed from the front (head). In Java, the `Queue` interface represents a queue data structure, and it is indeed part of the Java Collections Framework.

Let's break down each part of a queue in more depth and provide a code example using Java's `LinkedList` class, which implements the `Queue` interface:

1. **FIFO Principle**:
   - The FIFO principle means that the element inserted first will be the first one to be removed.
   - Imagine a real-world queue where people line up; the first person who joins the queue is the first one to be served.

2. **Queue Interface**:
   - The `Queue` interface in Java represents a queue data structure.
   - It extends the `Collection` interface and provides additional methods specific to queues, such as `offer()`, `poll()`, `peek()`, etc.

3. **Code Example**:
   ```java
   import java.util.LinkedList;
   import java.util.Queue;

   public class QueueExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Create a Queue using LinkedList (implements Queue)
           Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();

           // Adding elements to the queue
           queue.offer("Alice");
           queue.offer("Bob");
           queue.offer("Charlie");

           // Peek at the first element without removing it
           System.out.println("First element: " + queue.peek()); // Output: Alice

           // Remove and retrieve elements from the queue
           String served1 = queue.poll(); // Removes and returns "Alice"
           String served2 = queue.poll(); // Removes and returns "Bob"

           // Print the elements served
           System.out.println("Served: " + served1 + ", " + served2); // Output: Served: Alice, Bob

           // Peek again to see the new first element
           System.out.println("First element after serving: " + queue.peek()); // Output: Charlie
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example:
   - We create a `Queue` using `LinkedList`, which implements the `Queue` interface.
   - Elements are added to the queue using `offer()`.
   - We peek at the first element using `peek()` without removing it.
   - Elements are removed and retrieved using `poll()`.
   - The `Queue` maintains the order of elements and follows the FIFO principle.

4. **Key Methods**:
   - `offer(E e)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue if space is available.
   - `poll()`: Removes and returns the first element from the queue, or returns `null` if the queue is empty.
   - `peek()`: Retrieves the first element from the queue without removing it, or returns `null` if the queue is empty.
   - Other methods include `remove()`, `element()`, `isEmpty()`, `size()`, etc., inherited from the `Collection` interface.

In summary, a queue is a fundamental data structure that allows elements to be inserted at one end and removed from the other end following the FIFO principle. The `Queue` interface in Java, along with implementations like `LinkedList`, provides methods for managing queues efficiently.

## 27. Stack:

Yes, I'm familiar with stacks. A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a stack of items, where new items are added (pushed) onto the top of the stack, and items are removed (popped) from the top of the stack. Stacks are widely used in programming for tasks such as expression evaluation, function call management, and undo operations.

Let's delve into the key aspects of stacks in depth:

1. **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Principle**:
   - In a stack, the last item pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.
   - This behavior is similar to a stack of plates where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be removed.

2. **Stack Operations**:
   - **Push**: Adds an element onto the top of the stack.
   - **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
   - **Peek**: Retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it.
   - **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
   - **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Stacks can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays or linked lists.
   - In Java, the `Stack` class (from `java.util`) is available for stack operations, although it's recommended to use `Deque` implementations like `ArrayDeque` or `LinkedList` for better performance and flexibility.

4. **Code Example**:
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayDeque;
   import java.util.Deque;

   public class StackExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Create a stack using ArrayDeque (implements Deque, suitable for stack operations)
           Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();

           // Push elements onto the stack
           stack.push(10);
           stack.push(20);
           stack.push(30);

           // Peek at the top element without removing it
           System.out.println("Top element: " + stack.peek()); // Output: 30

           // Pop elements from the stack
           int popped1 = stack.pop(); // Removes and returns 30
           int popped2 = stack.pop(); // Removes and returns 20

           // Print the elements popped
           System.out.println("Popped: " + popped1 + ", " + popped2); // Output: Popped: 30, 20

           // Check if the stack is empty
           System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.isEmpty()); // Output: Is stack empty? false
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Expression evaluation (e.g., infix to postfix conversion, evaluating postfix expressions).
   - Managing function calls and recursive algorithms.
   - Undo operations in editors and applications.
   - Backtracking algorithms and depth-first search (DFS) in graphs.

# Map:

# 3. **HashMap**:
Sure, let's cover HashMap briefly:

**HashMap** is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the Map interface. It provides the basic implementation of the Map interface of storing the data in key-value pairs.

Here are some key points about HashMap:

1. **Key-Value Pairs**: HashMap stores data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it can only have one corresponding value.

2. **Null Values**: HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.

3. **Performance**: HashMap provides constant-time performance for basic operations like get() and put() if the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets.

4. **Iterating**: HashMap doesn't guarantee the order of its elements, either in insertion or iteration order.

5. **Thread-Safety**: HashMap is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally.

6. **Resizing**: HashMap automatically resizes itself when the number of elements crosses a certain threshold to maintain a reasonable load factor.

7. **Hashing**: Keys in a HashMap are used to calculate hash codes. The hash code determines the bucket location within the underlying array where the key-value pair will be stored.

8. **Collisions**: Collisions occur when two different keys have the same hash code. In such cases, HashMap uses a linked list or a tree (in Java 8 and later) to store multiple entries in the same bucket.

Overall, HashMap is widely used in Java for its efficiency in storing and retrieving key-value pairs and is a fundamental data structure for many Java applications.
Sure, here are some commonly used methods of the HashMap class in Java with examples:

1. **put(Key key, Value value)**: Adds a key-value pair to the HashMap.

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
hashMap.put("apple", 10);
hashMap.put("banana", 5);
```

2. **get(Object key)**: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key.

```java
int appleCount = hashMap.get("apple"); // Returns 10
```

3. **containsKey(Object key)**: Checks if the HashMap contains a specific key.

```java
boolean hasBanana = hashMap.containsKey("banana"); // Returns true
```

4. **containsValue(Object value)**: Checks if the HashMap contains a specific value.

```java
boolean hasValueTen = hashMap.containsValue(10); // Returns true
```

5. **remove(Object key)**: Removes the key-value pair associated with the specified key.

```java
hashMap.remove("banana");
```

6. **size()**: Returns the number of key-value pairs in the HashMap.

```java
int size = hashMap.size(); // Returns 1
```

7. **isEmpty()**: Checks if the HashMap is empty.

```java
boolean empty = hashMap.isEmpty(); // Returns false
```

8. **keySet()**: Returns a set view of the keys contained in the HashMap.

```java
Set<String> keys = hashMap.keySet(); // Returns ["apple"]
```

9. **values()**: Returns a collection view of the values contained in the HashMap.

```java
Collection<Integer> values = hashMap.values(); // Returns [10]
```

10. **entrySet()**: Returns a set view of the key-value mappings contained in the HashMap.

```java
Set<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = hashMap.entrySet();
for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : entries) {
    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
}
```
- Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.HashMap;

     public class HashMapExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating a HashMap of String keys and Integer values
             HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

             // Adding key-value pairs to the HashMap
             map.put("one", 1);
             map.put("two", 2);
             map.put("three", 3);

             // Accessing values by key
             System.out.println("Value for key 'two': " + map.get("two")); // Output: 2

             // Iterating through the HashMap
             for (String key : map.keySet()) {
                 System.out.println(key + ": " + map.get(key));
             }
         }
     }
     ```



## **LinkedHashMap**:
   - A `LinkedHashMap` is a variation of `HashMap` that maintains the insertion order of elements.
   - It combines the features of a hash table and a linked list for predictable iteration order.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
     import java.util.Map;

     public class LinkedHashMapExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // Creating a LinkedHashMap of Integer keys and String values
             LinkedHashMap<Integer, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();

             // Adding key-value pairs to the LinkedHashMap
             map.put(3, "Three");
             map.put(1, "One");
             map.put(2, "Two");

             // Accessing values by key (maintains insertion order)
             for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> entry : map.entrySet()) {
                 System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
             }
         }
     }
     ```

     ## 19. What is the criteria for hashmap? which datatypes can be hashmap key?

A `HashMap` in Java is a data structure that implements the `Map` interface and stores key-value pairs. The criteria for using a `HashMap` and the data types that can be used as keys are as follows:

1. **Criteria for Using HashMap**:
   - **Efficient Lookup**: `HashMap` provides fast lookup and retrieval of values based on keys. It uses hashing to efficiently map keys to their corresponding values.
   - **Unique Keys**: Each key in a `HashMap` must be unique. If you attempt to add a key-value pair with a key that already exists in the `HashMap`, the old value associated with that key will be replaced by the new value.
   - **Null Keys**: One key in a `HashMap` can be `null`. However, a `HashMap` can only contain one `null` key (since keys must be unique).
   - **Ordering**: A `HashMap` does not guarantee any specific order of elements. If you need a specific order, consider using a `LinkedHashMap` or `TreeMap`.

2. **Data Types for HashMap Keys**:
   - **Immutable Types**: The key used in a `HashMap` must be immutable. Immutable objects are those whose state cannot be modified after creation.
   - **Common Key Types**: Commonly used data types for keys in a `HashMap` include `String`, numeric types (`Integer`, `Long`, `Double`, etc.), and enum types.
   - **Custom Classes**: You can use custom classes as keys if they properly override the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods. This ensures correct behavior in terms of key uniqueness and hashing.
   - **Wrapper Classes**: Wrapper classes for primitive types (`Integer`, `Long`, `Double`, etc.) can also be used as keys.

Example of using `HashMap` with different key types:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // HashMap with Integer keys and String values
        HashMap<Integer, String> map1 = new HashMap<>();
        map1.put(1, "One");
        map1.put(2, "Two");

        // HashMap with String keys and Integer values
        HashMap<String, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();
        map2.put("one", 1);
        map2.put("two", 2);

        // HashMap with custom class keys
        HashMap<Student, String> studentMap = new HashMap<>();
        Student student1 = new Student("John", 123);
        Student student2 = new Student("Alice", 456);
        studentMap.put(student1, "Grade A");
        studentMap.put(student2, "Grade B");
    }

    static class Student {
        String name;
        int id;

        public Student(String name, int id) {
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id;
        }

        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return id; // Using id for hash code
        }

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object obj) {
            if (this == obj) return true;
            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
            Student student = (Student) obj;
            return id == student.id;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Hashcode and equals in context of Hashmap:

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the concepts of `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods in the context of `HashMap`.

1. **`hashCode()` Method**:
   - The `hashCode()` method is defined in the `Object` class and is inherited by all Java objects.
   - In the context of `HashMap`, the `hashCode()` method is crucial because it determines which bucket an entry (key-value pair) should be placed in.
   - The hash code is an integer value calculated based on the key's properties that are used for equality comparison.
   - The general contract of `hashCode()` is that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, then calling `hashCode()` on each of the objects must produce the same integer result.
   - Example implementation of `hashCode()` for a custom class used as a key in a `HashMap`:
     ```java
     public class KeyClass {
         private int id;
         private String name;

         // Constructor, getters, setters

         @Override
         public int hashCode() {
             // Generate hash code based on key properties
             return Objects.hash(id, name);
         }
     }
     ```

2. **`equals()` Method**:
   - The `equals()` method is also defined in the `Object` class and is used to compare the content of two objects for equality.
   - In the context of `HashMap`, the `equals()` method is crucial for determining if two keys are considered equal.
   - When a key is looked up in a `HashMap`, its `equals()` method is used to find the corresponding value.
   - The `equals()` method should compare the content of the key's properties for equality, not just their memory addresses.
   - Example implementation of `equals()` for the same custom class:
     ```java
     public class KeyClass {
         private int id;
         private String name;

         // Constructor, getters, setters

         @Override
         public boolean equals(Object obj) {
             if (this == obj) return true;
             if (!(obj instanceof KeyClass)) return false;
             KeyClass other = (KeyClass) obj;
             return id == other.id && Objects.equals(name, other.name);
         }
     }
     ```

In summary, the `hashCode()` method generates a hash code based on the key's properties, which is used for efficient storage and retrieval in the `HashMap`. The `equals()` method, on the other hand, compares the content of two keys for equality, ensuring that keys with the same content are treated as equal in the `HashMap`. Overriding these methods correctly is crucial for the proper functioning of a `HashMap` and ensuring consistency in key retrieval and equality checks.


## 21. You have a hashmap that you have overridden and you have overridden hashcode method of the hashmap when u code it alwsys returns a constant value why? u add multiple values to this hashmp, what would be the complexity for retriving the value from such hash?

If you override the `hashCode()` method of a `HashMap` to always return a constant value, it effectively reduces the `HashMap` to behave like a linked list. This is because all keys will map to the same bucket due to the constant hash code, resulting in a chain of entries in that bucket, rather than the typical hash table behavior with distributed keys across multiple buckets.

Here's an example of how you might override the `hashCode()` method of a custom class used as keys in a `HashMap` to always return a constant value:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class CustomKey {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    // Constructor, getters, setters

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        // Always return a constant value
        return 1;
    }
}

public class ConstantHashCodeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a HashMap with custom keys
        Map<CustomKey, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding entries with different keys (but constant hash code)
        CustomKey key1 = new CustomKey(1, "Key1");
        CustomKey key2 = new CustomKey(2, "Key2");
        CustomKey key3 = new CustomKey(3, "Key3");

        hashMap.put(key1, "Value1");
        hashMap.put(key2, "Value2");
        hashMap.put(key3, "Value3");

        // Retrieving a value (assuming keys are not equal)
        String value = hashMap.get(new CustomKey(2, "Key2"));
        System.out.println("Value retrieved: " + value);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `hashCode()` method of `CustomKey` always returns `1`, regardless of the key's actual properties. As a result, all keys are considered equal in terms of hashing, and they all map to the same bucket in the `HashMap`.

The complexity for retrieving a value from such a `HashMap` with a constant hash code is O(n), where n is the number of entries in the bucket. Since all keys map to the same bucket, the `HashMap` essentially degrades into a linked list for retrieval operations, leading to linear search time within that bucket. This defeats the purpose of using a hash map, which is designed for efficient key-value lookup based on hash codes and buckets.

## 22. hashmap key is stringbuilder and if you appendedn the value, will it still give the same value?

- the memory location of a `StringBuilder` object remains the same after appending to it because `StringBuilder` is mutable. This means that modifying the content of a `StringBuilder` key in a `HashMap` won't change its memory location, and the key's hash code and equality properties will remain consistent within the `HashMap`. Therefore, you can retrieve the value associated with the modified `StringBuilder` key correctly.

Here's an example demonstrating this behavior:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class StringBuilderKeyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<StringBuilder, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

        StringBuilder key = new StringBuilder("Key");
        hashMap.put(key, "Value");

        // Modifying the key after adding it to the HashMap
        key.append("Appended");

        // Retrieving the value using the modified key
        String value = hashMap.get(key);
        System.out.println("Value retrieved: " + value); // Output: Value
    }
}
```

In this example, even though the `StringBuilder` key (`key`) is modified by appending "Appended" to it after adding it to the `HashMap`, the `HashMap` correctly retrieves the value associated with the modified key. This is because the `StringBuilder` key's memory location (object reference) remains the same, ensuring consistent hashing and equality checks within the `HashMap`.

## 24. Rehashing

Rehashing is a process used in hash table data structures, such as Java's `HashMap` implementation, to adjust the size of the hash table and reorganize its elements when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold. The purpose of rehashing is to maintain a balance between the number of elements stored and the size of the hash table, ensuring efficient performance and reducing the likelihood of collisions.

Here's how rehashing typically works:

1. **Initial Hash Table**:
   - When elements are added to a hash table, they are placed into buckets based on their hash codes.
   - The hash table initially has a certain capacity, which determines the number of buckets available for storing elements.

2. **Load Factor**:
   - The load factor of a hash table is the ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets.
   - When the load factor exceeds a predefined threshold (commonly around 0.75 for `HashMap`), it indicates that the hash table is becoming crowded, increasing the chances of collisions and potentially affecting performance.

3. **Rehashing Process**:
   - When the load factor exceeds the threshold, rehashing is triggered.
   - Rehashing involves creating a new hash table with an increased capacity (often doubled) and redistributing the elements from the old hash table into the new one.
   - The redistribution is done by recalculating the hash codes of elements based on the new table size and placing them into the appropriate buckets in the new hash table.

4. **Benefits of Rehashing**:
   - Ensures a balanced distribution of elements: Rehashing helps distribute elements more evenly across buckets, reducing the likelihood of collisions and improving lookup performance.
   - Maintains performance: By adjusting the hash table size based on the number of elements, rehashing helps maintain a consistent level of performance as the number of elements grows.
   - Supports dynamic resizing: Hash tables that employ rehashing can dynamically resize themselves based on the number of elements, allowing them to adapt to changing workloads efficiently.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. HAshmap and HashCode,  same hashcode for same values? internal working of hashmap?
Let's break down the concepts of HashMap, hashCode, and how they relate to each other:

1. **HashMap**:
   - `HashMap` is a data structure in Java that stores key-value pairs.
   - It uses hashing to efficiently store and retrieve elements based on their keys.
   - Each key in a `HashMap` must be unique, and it maps to exactly one value.
   - Example:
     ```java
     HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
     map.put("apple", 10);
     map.put("banana", 20);
     int value = map.get("apple"); // Retrieves the value 10 associated with the key "apple"
     ```

2. **hashCode**:
- `hashCode` is a method in Java's `Object` class that returns an integer value representing the object's hash code.
- The hash code is used by hash-based data structures like `HashMap` to determine the storage location of an object.
- The `hashCode` method must be overridden in custom classes to provide meaningful hash codes based on the object's contents.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class MyClass {
         private int value;

         public MyClass(int value) {
             this.value = value;
         }

         @Override
         public int hashCode() {
             return Objects.hash(value);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Same hashCode for Same Values**:
- If two objects have the same values (i.e., their state is the same), their `hashCode` method should ideally return the same hash code.
- This ensures that objects with equal content are likely to be stored in the same bucket in a hash-based data structure like `HashMap`.
- However, it's possible for different objects to have the same hash code (hash code collision), but good hash code implementations minimize collisions.
```java
 HashMap<Integer, String> hs = new HashMap<>();
        hs.put(1, "Satish");
        hs.put(2, "Satish");
        System.out.println(hs.get(1).hashCode());
        System.out.println(hs.get(2).hashCode());
        // returns same bucket value
```


4. **Internal Working of HashMap**:
- When you `put` a key-value pair into a `HashMap`, the key's hash code is calculated using its `hashCode` method.
- The hash code is used to determine the bucket (index) where the key-value pair will be stored in an array.
- If multiple keys have the same hash code (collision), a linked list or a tree (in Java 8+) is used to store entries in the same bucket.
- When you `get` a value from a `HashMap`, the key's hash code is again used to find the correct bucket, and then the key's `equals` method is used to find the exact match.
- `HashMap` automatically handles resizing and rehashing to maintain a good balance between load factor and performance.

- In summary, `HashMap` uses the `hashCode` of keys to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs. The `hashCode` method should return the same hash code for objects with equal content, and `HashMap` internally handles collisions by using `linked lists or trees` in buckets with multiple entries.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 12. Can HashMap and Hashtable contains null values?
Yes, both `HashMap` and `Hashtable` in Java can contain `null` values, but with some differences:

1. **HashMap**: In a `HashMap`, both keys and values can be `null`. This means you can have a `null` key associated with a value, or you can have a non-null key with a `null` value. However, it's important to note that `HashMap` allows only one `null` key because it does not permit duplicate keys. 

   ```java
   import java.util.HashMap;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           HashMap<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
           hashMap.put(null, "value"); // Valid
           hashMap.put("key", null);   // Valid
           hashMap.put(null, null);    // Overwrites previous null key

           System.out.println(hashMap); // Output: {null=null, key=null}
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Hashtable**: Similar to `HashMap`, `Hashtable` can contain `null` values, but it has different behavior regarding `null` keys. In a `Hashtable`, neither keys nor values can be `null`. If you try to insert `null` keys or values into a `Hashtable`, it will throw a `NullPointerException`.

   ```java
   import java.util.Hashtable;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Hashtable<String, String> hashtable = new Hashtable<>();
           hashtable.put(null, "value"); // Throws NullPointerException
           hashtable.put("key", null);   // Throws NullPointerException

           System.out.println(hashtable); // This line will not be reached
       }
   }
   ```

So, while both `HashMap` and `Hashtable` can contain `null` values, you need to be cautious about inserting `null` keys into a `Hashtable` due to its different behavior and potential for runtime exceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 28. Map vs Collection? why map interface does not extends collection interface?

The distinction between the `Map` interface and the `Collection` interface in Java lies in their fundamental purposes and the way they organize and store data.

1. **Purpose**:
   - `Collection`: The `Collection` interface represents a group of objects, typically referred to as elements or items. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and iterate over elements. Examples of collections include lists, sets, queues, and deques.
   - `Map`: The `Map` interface represents a mapping between keys and values. It stores key-value pairs and allows you to associate keys with values, retrieve values based on keys, and perform operations such as adding, removing, and updating mappings.

2. **Organizational Structure**:
   - `Collection`: Collections organize elements in a linear or hierarchical structure, depending on the specific collection type (e.g., lists are linear, sets are unordered, trees are hierarchical).
   - `Map`: Maps organize data as key-value pairs, where each key is unique within the map, and each key is associated with exactly one value.

3. **Interfaces**:
   - `Collection` Interface: Represents the basic operations common to all collections, such as adding elements (`add()`), removing elements (`remove()`), checking containment (`contains()`), iterating over elements, etc.
   - `Map` Interface: Represents operations specific to key-value mappings, such as adding mappings (`put()`), removing mappings (`remove()`), retrieving values based on keys (`get()`), checking for key existence, etc.

Regarding why the `Map` interface does not extend the `Collection` interface, there are several reasons:

- **Key-Value vs Element**:
  - The primary reason is that maps deal with key-value pairs, which is fundamentally different from collections that deal with individual elements.
  - Extending `Collection` for maps would not make sense in terms of the operations and behaviors expected from a map.

- **Unique Key Requirement**:
  - Maps enforce the uniqueness of keys, whereas collections do not enforce such uniqueness for elements.
  - This unique key requirement and the associated operations (e.g., getting values by keys) are not applicable to general collections.

- **Semantic Differences**:
  - The semantic meaning and usage scenarios of maps are distinct from collections, warranting separate interfaces to maintain clarity and specificity in programming.

Despite not extending `Collection`, maps and collections share common ground in that they both facilitate data storage and manipulation. However, their underlying organizational structures, purposes, and operations make them distinct interfaces in the Java Collections Framework.



| Collection Interfaces      | Description                                                                                   | Implementations                                                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `List`                      | Ordered collection of elements with duplicates allowed.                                       | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`, `Stack`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc. |
