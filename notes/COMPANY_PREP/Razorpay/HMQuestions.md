- But later from testing team they again sent this task to reverify, as it were not passing the test cases.
- Then I again went through the story and later understood that that particular APIs should be secured which I didn't did.

- And me and one more person responsible for giving him the KT, so what we did we taught him the basic needful things for the project so that he can start working and assigned few courses. So ultimately he was also working well and everyone was okay abut his work.

- But once I joined Razorpay you can call them to take a feedback about me.

## 35. What was the toughest decision you ever had to make?
- For me choosing the last project was a toughest decision to make.
- Like at that time there was few options and I was looking for UI related projects but automatically I got assigned to this project.

- So in that session, everyone from all the locations joined, almost 35 people were attending that session inclusing the leadership.
- So in one phase they were presenting the problems one by one on a screen and asking for solutions.
- So there was one problem statement, that they have recently acruired a Company which is Vivant, which is mainly in business of Home automation products.
- So they wanted to know out NRG consumers about the products of Vivant, so everyone were suggesting I also randomly raised a hand and mentioned creating a closable windows on screen of consumers, so that they will be aware about the Vivant's products.
- Fo this they agreed and noted down this thing and appreciated.
- Also in second phase they were suggesting randon improvements if anyone is thinking of, so once is past I was checking the codebase for ERM and I noticed one thing that for sending emails, we're using SimpleEmailSender dependency, instead we can use MimeEmailSender which will help us to send webpages also along with the email, like nowdays everyone is using this.
- So I added this also, and for this also I got a appreciation.

- My preference on working on single project and multiple projects depends on factors like scope of the projects.
- Like is the project I am currently working requires less time and if I am getting free time then I'll choose to working on multiple projects.
