# Roles and Responsibilities:

So this is about the project and talking about my roles and responsibilities:
- So in this project I worked as a Java Backend Developer and i was responsible for developing RESTful APIs using Springboot.
- Along with this I was responsible for monitoring the one of the developement server of us, like if it went down or not woring fine then my work was to login to PUTTY and restart the server.
- In terms of collaboration, I actively participated in Daily Scrum calls, Spring planning sessions, and Sprint Review meetings, contributing to the overall project alignment and progress tracking
- I was also responsible for writing Unit test cases for the code I written to increase the code coverage of the codebase.
- Talking about my major work I did in this project is:
  1. I was worked with team on implementing Email notification service, like sending emails to consumers is specific event triggered.
  2. At one point of time Client was planning to change few policies and for that few minor changes in billing and invoice generating service were required on that part also I worked on.
  3. So in CRM module we had a old ticketing tool which has basic functionality, So our work was to replace that ticketing tool with new ticketing tool. So in this part also I worked mostly on new Query, Query current status managing, and auto-replys for commonly asked questions. 
- And along with this I had one more task, like arranging the calls with functional team if anyone from the team have any doubts regarding the requirement.
So yes, this was the project I have worked on and the roles and responsibilities of mine in this project.

## How did you design and implement the RESTful APIs for the ERM project?

"In designing and implementing RESTful APIs for the ERM project, we followed a systematic approach to ensure efficiency, security, and clarity. Here are the key steps we followed:

- 1. Requirement Clarification: The first step after receiving requirements from the product owner was to clarify them thoroughly. This involved understanding the purpose of each API, its expected behavior, and any specific business rules or constraints.

- 2. Security Analysis: We prioritized security by analyzing whether APIs were accessible to consumers or restricted to internal NRG staff only. This assessment helped us define access controls, authentication mechanisms, and data protection measures for each API.

- 3. API Design Principles: I adhered to established API design principles for naming conventions, method types, and endpoint structure. This consistency in naming and structure not only improved API readability but also facilitated easier maintenance and scalability.

- 4. Documentation and Testing: We emphasized comprehensive documentation for each API, including endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, and usage instructions. Additionally, I wrote extensive unit tests to validate API functionality, ensure error handling, and maintain code reliability.

- 5. Performance Optimization: As part of the design process, I optimized API performance by minimizing unnecessary data transfers, implementing caching mechanisms, and leveraging asynchronous processing for resource-intensive operations.

By following these steps, we were able to design and implement RESTful APIs for the ERM project that met functional requirements, maintained high standards of security, and provided a seamless experience for both internal users and consumers."

## How did you approach the development of the new ticketing tool for ERM?
Here's how you might respond to the question about developing the new ticketing tool for ERM during an interview:

"Developing the new ticketing tool for ERM was a collaborative effort that involved addressing specific challenges faced by the client's previous consumer query management system. Here's how we approached the development process:

1. **Identifying Issues:** We recognized that the old tool lacked functionality for consumers to check the current status of their queries, leading to poor service delivery. Consumers were also unable to direct queries to the appropriate teams, resulting in delays and inefficiencies.

2. **Client Requirements:** Our primary focus was on enhancing consumer experience by allowing them to track query statuses and introducing different query types for streamlined routing to relevant teams, such as Billing or Technical Support.

3. **Technology Stack:** We utilized Spring Boot and Java for backend development, leveraging the robustness and scalability of these technologies. MySQL RDS was chosen for database management, ensuring data integrity and reliability. For the frontend, we adopted React.js to build an intuitive and responsive user interface.

4. **Agile Development:** We adopted an agile approach, breaking down the development process into sprints spanning 3-4 iterations. A dedicated team of 10 backend developers, including myself, collaborated closely to deliver incremental improvements and iterate based on client feedback.

5. **Integration with CRM:** Integration with the CRM system was crucial to ensure seamless communication and data sharing between the ticketing tool and other modules. This integration facilitated a holistic view of consumer interactions and improved overall service management.

By aligning our development efforts with client requirements, leveraging modern technologies, and prioritizing user experience, we successfully delivered a robust and user-friendly ticketing tool that addressed the shortcomings of the previous system and enhanced consumer satisfaction."

## What experience do you have with AWS, and how have you applied it in your projects?

"I developed an interest in cloud computing after coming across a post on LinkedIn last year. This prompted me to explore AWS further, leading me to complete a 14-hour AWS Udemy course and clear 5 AWS-provided sample tests. This effort earned me a free voucher to take the official AWS certification exam, which I passed in September.

Although I haven't had direct project experience with AWS in my current role, I actively sought opportunities to apply my AWS knowledge. I tried to convince my project manager to transfer me to teams or projects utilizing AWS for application development, but unfortunately, I didn't get that opportunity.

However, to gain hands-on experience, I utilized resources like YouTube channels to learn how to deploy a JAR file on AWS. This exercise helped me understand AWS deployment processes and enhanced my practical AWS skills.

I am eager to leverage my AWS certification and continue exploring AWS's capabilities in future projects to contribute effectively to cloud-based solutions."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Describe a challenging technical problem you faced and how you resolved it.

- "One challenging technical problem I encountered was when I was tasked with developing a GET REST API for the Ticketing tool. This API needed to interact with another microservice, perform certain operations, and then transfer the results in the response body. Initially, I struggled to devise the logic to implement this functionality effectively.

- To overcome this challenge, I sought assistance from a peer team member who had experience with similar integration tasks. We collaborated closely, discussing the requirements, analyzing the data flow between the microservices, and identifying the necessary operations and data transformations.

- Through this collaboration, I gained insights into best practices for microservice interactions, data handling techniques, and API design considerations. With my peer's guidance and our joint effort, I was able to develop the GET REST API successfully, ensuring seamless communication and accurate data transfer between the microservices.

- This experience taught me the importance of leveraging team collaboration and seeking expertise when facing complex technical challenges. It also reinforced the value of continuous learning and sharing knowledge within the team to achieve optimal solutions."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## *Can you provide an example of a time you had to manage multiple deadlines? How did you prioritize tasks?

"In a particular sprint, towards the end of the week, I found myself with a significant number of pending tasks. Recognizing the potential challenges in completing all tasks within the deadline, I assessed the tasks to identify those that were feasible for me to complete within the given timeframe.

However, I also identified a few tasks that I anticipated might pose difficulties and could potentially impact the sprint's final delivery. To address this, I proactively discussed my concerns with my Team Lead, explaining the situation and the potential risks associated with those tasks.

Fortunately, my Team Lead was supportive and understanding. He agreed to help by taking on three of the tasks from my plate and reassigning them to other team members who had the capacity to handle them effectively.

With this task redistribution and clear prioritization of doable tasks, I was able to focus my efforts and complete the remaining tasks before the deadline. This collaboration and proactive approach not only ensured timely delivery but also fostered a supportive team dynamic where we worked together to achieve our sprint goals."

## How do you approach debugging and troubleshooting issues in your code?

When approaching debugging and troubleshooting issues in my code, I follow a systematic approach to identify and resolve issues efficiently:

1. **Reproduce the Issue:** I start by reproducing the issue to understand its scope and impact. This involves replicating the problem scenario in a controlled environment, such as a development or testing environment, to observe the issue firsthand.

2. **Review Logs and Errors:** I review logs, error messages, and stack traces to gather information about the root cause of the issue. This helps me pinpoint where the problem is occurring and provides insights into potential causes.

3. **Isolate the Problem:** I isolate the problematic code or component by using debugging tools and techniques. This may involve stepping through the code line by line, setting breakpoints, and inspecting variable values to understand the program flow and identify anomalies.

4. **Check Dependencies:** I check dependencies, libraries, and external integrations that the code relies on to ensure they are functioning correctly. This includes verifying API calls, database connections, and external service integrations for any errors or inconsistencies.

5. **Test and Validate Fixes:** Once I identify the root cause of the issue, I implement fixes or modifications to the code. I then conduct thorough testing and validation to ensure the issue is resolved and that the code behaves as expected under different scenarios.

6. **Document and Learn:** Finally, I document the debugging process, including the steps taken, solutions implemented, and lessons learned. This documentation serves as a reference for future troubleshooting efforts and helps in continuous improvement and knowledge sharing within the team.
