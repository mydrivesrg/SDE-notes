**The Excellergy Revenue Manager (ERM) architecture is designed to support efficient revenue management processes for Direct Energy (NRG). Below is an overview of the architecture:**

#### 1. **Frontend:**
- **Technology Stack:** React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **Role:** The frontend is responsible for providing a responsive and intuitive user interface for users to interact with the application. It handles client-side rendering, user input validation, and communication with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Components:**
  - **User Interface:** Developed using React.js to ensure a dynamic and responsive user experience.
  - **State Management:** Managed using Redux to maintain the application state across different components and pages.

#### 2. **Backend:**
- **Technology Stack:** Java 1.8, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Maven
- **Role:** The backend is responsible for business logic, data processing, and communication with the database. It provides RESTful APIs to the frontend and handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Components:**
  - **RESTful APIs:** Implemented using Spring Boot to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
  - **Email Notification Service:** Configured within Spring Boot to send automated notifications to customers regarding invoice generation, payment reminders, and billing updates.
  - **Billing and Invoicing:** Developed functionalities for billing customers, generating invoices, and forecasting revenue.

#### 3. **Database:**
- **Technology Stack:** Oracle MySQL
- **Role:** The database stores all necessary data, including customer information, billing records, invoices, and user credentials.
- **Components:**
  - **Schema Design:** Designed to support the various entities and relationships within the ERM system, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.

#### 4. **Security:**
- **Technology Stack:** Spring Security
- **Role:** Ensures secure access to the application by handling user authentication and authorization.
- **Components:**
  - **Authentication:** Uses Spring Security to verify user credentials and manage sessions.
  - **Authorization:** Implements role-based access control to restrict access to specific features and data based on user roles.

#### 5. **Microservices:**
- **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, Docker
- **Role:** The application is designed using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.
- **Components:**
  - **Service Deployment:** Each service is deployed independently, allowing for better resource utilization and easier updates.
  - **Inter-Service Communication:** Services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs.

#### 6. **Development Tools:**
- **Tools Used:** Eclipse, Git, GitHub, Postman, AWS
- **Role:** These tools support development, version control, API testing, and cloud deployment.
- **Components:**
  - **Version Control:** Managed using Git and GitHub to track changes and collaborate with team members.
  - **API Testing:** Performed using Postman to ensure the functionality and reliability of APIs.
  - **Cloud Deployment:** Utilizes AWS for deploying and managing the application in a scalable and reliable environment.

Certainly! Here are the three stories separated for clarity:

---

**Interviewer:** Can you tell me about a project where you enhanced an existing functionality?

**Satish:** Sure. In the ERM project, I worked on adding and modifying the email sending service. While the email functionality already existed using the spring-boot-starter-email dependency, I added an unsubscribe functionality to improve user control over their email preferences. Additionally, I identified that the CRM system lacked email notifications for several triggers. I implemented email notifications for 10 specific triggers, such as consumer details update confirmation. This ensured consumers received a confirmation email whenever their details were updated, enhancing the transparency and reliability of our system.

---

**Interviewer:** Can you describe a development task where you transitioned from bug fixing to a more complex role?

**Satish:** Absolutely. One of the pivotal moments in my career was when I worked on implementing a new ticketing tool within the ERM project. Initially, my tasks were focused on bug fixing, but this project marked my transition to development tasks. I was responsible for creating an entirely new ticketing system, which involved understanding user requirements, designing the solution, and implementing it. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also helped me learn project management and user-centric design principles.

---

**Interviewer:** Can you share an example of how you ensured security in your projects?

**Satish:** Of course. In the ERM project, I worked on the security aspects after developing APIs. Using Spring Security, I configured access control to ensure that only authorized users could access specific endpoints. I used requestMatchers to filter API access based on user roles and permissions. This involved detailed configuration and testing to ensure that the system was secure while still being user-friendly. Implementing these security measures was crucial in protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of our system.
